# Central Superstore Sales Insights Dashboard

This project is a data visualization dashboard built in Tableau, focused on sales analysis for the Central region of a fictional superstore. It provides insights into monthly sales trends, product performance, regional distribution, and customer impact, enabling data-driven decision-making for business stakeholders.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to deliver a comprehensive sales dashboard that provides quick, actionable insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
- Monthly sales trends
- Top-performing products
- Regional sales distribution
- Distinct customer counts and profit margins

This dashboard helps stakeholders track business performance, identify growth opportunities, and make informed strategic decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project originates from the Central Superstore's sales records. It includes essential information on customer orders, shipping dates, product categories, sales amounts, discounts, and profits. Key columns in the dataset include:
- **Order Details**: `Order ID`, `Order Date`, `Ship Date`, `Ship Mode`
- **Customer Information**: `Customer ID`, `Customer Name`, `Segment`
- **Product Details**: `Product ID`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Product Name`
- **Sales Metrics**: `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Profit`

This data provides a comprehensive view of the Central region's sales activities, enabling a multidimensional analysis of the business.

## Key Questions Answered
The dashboard is designed to answer critical business questions:
1. **What are the monthly sales trends?**
2. **Which products and categories are performing best?**
3. **How are sales distributed across different states?**
4. **How many distinct customers were served, and what impact did they have on sales and profit?**

## Dashboard Components
The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
- **KPIs Section**: Displays total sales, total profit, and the distinct count of customers.
- **Monthly Sales Trend**: A line chart with circular markers showing monthly sales performance.
- **Sales by State**: A color-coded map showing sales distribution across states in the Central region.
- **Sales by Product Category**: A bar chart representing sales by product subcategory, with conditional coloring to highlight above- and below-average performers.

- **Data Preparation**: Connecting to and cleaning the Central Superstore dataset.
- **Calculated Fields**: Creating custom calculations, such as above-average sales indicators.
- **Mapping**: Visualizing sales by state on a color-coded map.
- **Dual-Axis Line and Circle Chart**: Creating a line chart with circle markers to show monthly trends clearly.
